# CANSAT FSW2 Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. FSW_CONF Configuration Issue
**Problem**: The comm app was failing with error `module 'lib.config' has no attribute 'FSW_CONF'`

**Root Cause**: The `lib/config.py` file was missing the FSW configuration constants that other modules expected.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added missing FSW configuration constants to `lib/config.py`:
  - `CONF_NONE = 0`
  - `CONF_PAYLOAD = 1` 
  - `CONF_CONTAINER = 2`
  - `CONF_ROCKET = 3`
- Added `FSW_CONF_MAPPING` dictionary to map string modes to integer constants
- Added `FSW_CONF` variable that maps the current FSW mode to the appropriate constant

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/config.py` - Added missing FSW configuration constants

### 2. Camera Permission Issue
**Problem**: Camera app was failing with `Permission denied: '/home/pi'` error

**Root Cause**: The camera module was trying to create directories in `/home/pi` which requires root permissions.

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed hardcoded absolute paths to relative paths in the project directory:
  - `VIDEO_DIR` from `/home/pi/cansat_videos` to `logs/cansat_videos`
  - `TEMP_DIR` from `/tmp/cansat_camera` to `logs/cansat_camera_temp`
  - `LOG_DIR` from `/home/pi/cansat_logs` to `logs/cansat_camera_logs`

**Files Modified**:
- `camera/camera.py` - Updated directory paths
- `camera/camera_config.py` - Updated video directory path

### 3. Message Structure Issue
**Problem**: FlightLogic was failing with `'MsgStructure' object has no attribute 'MsgData'` errors

**Root Cause**: FlightLogic was trying to access `recv_msg.MsgData` but the `MsgStructure` class only has a `data` attribute.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated all `recv_msg.MsgData` references to `recv_msg.data` in FlightLogic
- Added handlers for previously unknown message IDs (2503, 2603, 1203)
- Added missing `MID_RocketMotorStandby` to `FlightlogicAppArg`

**Files Modified**:
- `flight_logic/flightlogicapp.py` - Fixed MsgData references and added message handlers
- `lib/appargs.py` - Added missing MID_RocketMotorStandby

### 4. IMU Sensor Error Handling
**Problem**: IMU was failing with `unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'NoneType' and 'NoneType'` errors

**Root Cause**: IMU sensor was returning None values that weren't properly handled before mathematical operations.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added additional None value checks for quaternion data
- Added try-catch blocks around mathematical calculations
- Improved error logging for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `imu/imu.py` - Enhanced None value handling and error checking

### 5. Process Management Issue
**Problem**: Process 16 (Comm app) was dead and causing repeated warnings

**Root Cause**: The comm app was failing during initialization due to the FSW_CONF issue, causing the process to terminate.

**Fix Applied**:
- The FSW_CONF fix should resolve this issue as the comm app will now be able to initialize properly.

### 6. Thermal Camera Format Error
**Problem**: Thermal camera was failing with `TypeError: unsupported format string passed to NoneType.__format__`

**Root Cause**: Thermal camera variables (THERMAL_AVG, THERMAL_MIN, THERMAL_MAX) were None when trying to format them.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added None value checks before formatting thermal camera data
- Added try-catch blocks around the send_cam_data function
- Provided default values (0.0) when thermal data is None

**Files Modified**:
- `thermal_camera/thermo_cameraapp.py` - Added None value handling for thermal data formatting

### 7. Motor Status Display Improvement
**Problem**: Motor open/close status was displayed as long text messages, reducing readability

**Root Cause**: FlightLogic was logging detailed motor status messages instead of simple numeric indicators.

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed motor status logging to simple numeric format: 0 (open) / 1 (closed)
- Added motor status transmission to Comm app for telemetry inclusion
- Removed "Invalid float value" warning messages from Comm app
- Added motor status field to telemetry data structure

**Files Modified**:
- `flight_logic/flightlogicapp.py` - Simplified motor status logging, added status transmission
- `comm/commapp.py` - Removed warning messages, added motor status to telemetry
- `lib/appargs.py` - Added MID_SendMotorStatus message ID

### 8. TelemetryAppArg Missing Issue
**Problem**: Camera app was failing with "module 'lib.appargs' has no attribute 'TelemetryAppArg'" error

**Root Cause**: TelemetryAppArg class was not defined in lib/appargs.py

**Fix Applied**:
- Added TelemetryAppArg class with AppID 3 and MID_ReceiveTlmData message ID
- Positioned between HkAppArg and sensor subsystems for proper organization

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/appargs.py` - Added TelemetryAppArg class definition

### 9. Camera Command Integration
**Problem**: libcamera-hello command not found, need to use available cam command for camera operations

**Root Cause**: libcamera-tools package provides cam command instead of libcamera-hello

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated hardware detection to use cam -l command
- Replaced FFmpeg-based recording with cam command
- Created comprehensive test script for new camera implementation

**Files Modified**:
- `camera/camera.py` - Updated hardware detection and recording functions to use cam command

**Files Created**:
- `test_camera_cam.py` - Test script for new camera implementation

### 10. Camera Hardware Detection Issue
**Problem**: No independent way to test Pi Camera functionality outside of the main CANSAT system

**Root Cause**: Camera testing was only possible through the main system, making debugging difficult.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created standalone camera testing scripts for independent testing and debugging
- Added comprehensive camera installation and setup scripts
- Created detailed documentation for camera usage and troubleshooting

**Files Created**:
- `camera/standalone_camera.py` - Independent camera test script with interactive interface
- `camera/simple_camera_test.py` - Quick camera functionality test script
- `camera/install_camera.sh` - Automated camera installation script
- `camera/CAMERA_README.md` - Comprehensive camera usage guide

### 11. Final Camera Integration Issues (NEW)
**Problem**: Several issues discovered during main application testing:
- FFmpeg timeout causing camera initialization failure
- FlightLogicAppArg vs FlightlogicAppArg case sensitivity issue
- Camera status update function missing required parameter

**Root Cause**: 
- FFmpeg check was too strict and causing failures
- Inconsistent naming between appargs definitions and usage
- Function signature mismatch in camera status updates

**Fix Applied**:
1. **FFmpeg Check Relaxation** (`camera/camera.py`):
   - Changed FFmpeg timeout from 5 to 10 seconds
   - Made FFmpeg check optional (warning instead of error)
   - Camera initialization continues even if FFmpeg fails

2. **Case Sensitivity Fix** (`camera/cameraapp.py`):
   - Changed `FlightLogicAppArg` to `FlightlogicAppArg` to match definition
   - Fixed import and usage consistency

3. **Camera Status Update Fix** (`camera/cameraapp.py`):
   - Simplified camera status update to use default "READY" state
   - Removed dependency on camera_process parameter

4. **Test Script** (`test_final_fixes.py`):
   - Created comprehensive test for all final fixes
   - Tests imports, camera functions, and integration

**Files Modified**:
- `camera/camera.py` - Relaxed FFmpeg requirements
- `camera/cameraapp.py` - Fixed case sensitivity and status updates

**Files Created**:
- `test_final_fixes.py` - Final integration test script

```

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Error Handling
Consider adding better error handling in the main process to gracefully handle app initialization failures without causing the entire system to become unstable.

### 2. Logging
The logging system appears to be working well. Consider adding more detailed error messages to help diagnose future issues.

### 3. Configuration Management
The new configuration system in `lib/config.py` provides better structure. Consider migrating all hardcoded values to use this centralized configuration system.

### 4. Directory Structure
The relative path approach for camera directories is more portable. Consider applying this pattern to other modules that might have similar permission issues.

### 5. Sensor Robustness
Consider implementing retry mechanisms and fallback values for sensor readings to improve system stability during hardware issues.

### 6. Camera Testing
Use the new standalone camera scripts for:
- Initial camera setup verification
- Troubleshooting camera issues
- Testing camera functionality independently
- Performance optimization
- Quality testing

### 7. Hardware Diagnostics
For persistent hardware issues:
- Check I2C bus connections and addresses
- Verify sensor power supply
- Monitor system temperature
- Check for electromagnetic interference
- Consider adding hardware watchdog timers
