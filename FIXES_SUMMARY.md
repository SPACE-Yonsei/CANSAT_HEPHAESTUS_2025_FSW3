# CANSAT FSW2 Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. FSW_CONF Configuration Issue
**Problem**: The comm app was failing with error `module 'lib.config' has no attribute 'FSW_CONF'`

**Root Cause**: The `lib/config.py` file was missing the FSW configuration constants that other modules expected.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added missing FSW configuration constants to `lib/config.py`:
  - `CONF_NONE = 0`
  - `CONF_PAYLOAD = 1` 
  - `CONF_CONTAINER = 2`
  - `CONF_ROCKET = 3`
- Added `FSW_CONF_MAPPING` dictionary to map string modes to integer constants
- Added `FSW_CONF` variable that maps the current FSW mode to the appropriate constant

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/config.py` - Added missing FSW configuration constants

### 2. Camera Permission Issue
**Problem**: Camera app was failing with `Permission denied: '/home/pi'` error

**Root Cause**: The camera module was trying to create directories in `/home/pi` which requires root permissions.

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed hardcoded absolute paths to relative paths in the project directory:
  - `VIDEO_DIR` from `/home/pi/cansat_videos` to `logs/cansat_videos`
  - `TEMP_DIR` from `/tmp/cansat_camera` to `logs/cansat_camera_temp`
  - `LOG_DIR` from `/home/pi/cansat_logs` to `logs/cansat_camera_logs`

**Files Modified**:
- `camera/camera.py` - Updated directory paths
- `camera/camera_config.py` - Updated video directory path

### 3. Message Structure Issue
**Problem**: FlightLogic was failing with `'MsgStructure' object has no attribute 'MsgData'` errors

**Root Cause**: FlightLogic was trying to access `recv_msg.MsgData` but the `MsgStructure` class only has a `data` attribute.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated all `recv_msg.MsgData` references to `recv_msg.data` in FlightLogic
- Added handlers for previously unknown message IDs (2503, 2603, 1203)
- Added missing `MID_RocketMotorStandby` to `FlightlogicAppArg`

**Files Modified**:
- `flight_logic/flightlogicapp.py` - Fixed MsgData references and added message handlers
- `lib/appargs.py` - Added missing MID_RocketMotorStandby

### 4. IMU Sensor Error Handling
**Problem**: IMU was failing with `unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'NoneType' and 'NoneType'` errors

**Root Cause**: IMU sensor was returning None values that weren't properly handled before mathematical operations.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added additional None value checks for quaternion data
- Added try-catch blocks around mathematical calculations
- Improved error logging for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `imu/imu.py` - Enhanced None value handling and error checking

### 5. Process Management Issue
**Problem**: Process 16 (Comm app) was dead and causing repeated warnings

**Root Cause**: The comm app was failing during initialization due to the FSW_CONF issue, causing the process to terminate.

**Fix Applied**:
- The FSW_CONF fix should resolve this issue as the comm app will now be able to initialize properly.

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Run the Test Scripts
```bash
# Test configuration and camera fixes
python test_fixes.py

# Test message structure fixes
python test_message_fixes.py
```

These scripts will verify:
- ✅ Config module imports successfully
- ✅ FSW_CONF constants are available
- ✅ Camera directories can be created without permission issues
- ✅ Comm app can import config without errors
- ✅ Message structure works correctly
- ✅ FlightLogic can import without errors
- ✅ All required message IDs exist
- ✅ Motor app can import without errors

### 2. Test the Main Application
```bash
python main.py
```

Expected behavior after fixes:
- ✅ All apps should load successfully
- ✅ No FSW_CONF errors in comm app
- ✅ No permission errors in camera app
- ✅ No "Process 16 is dead" warnings
- ✅ No "MsgData" attribute errors in FlightLogic
- ✅ No "MID_RocketMotorStandby" missing errors in motor app
- ✅ Reduced IMU sensor errors
- ✅ Proper handling of all message types

### 3. Verify Individual Components
```bash
# Test config module
python -c "from lib import config; print(f'FSW_CONF: {config.FSW_CONF}')"

# Test camera module
python -c "from camera import camera; print('Camera module imports successfully')"

# Test comm module
python -c "from comm import commapp; print('Comm module imports successfully')"

# Test message structure
python -c "from lib import msgstructure; msg = msgstructure.MsgStructure(); print('Message structure works')"

# Test flight logic
python -c "from flight_logic import flightlogicapp; print('FlightLogic imports successfully')"
```

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Error Handling
Consider adding better error handling in the main process to gracefully handle app initialization failures without causing the entire system to become unstable.

### 2. Logging
The logging system appears to be working well. Consider adding more detailed error messages to help diagnose future issues.

### 3. Configuration Management
The new configuration system in `lib/config.py` provides better structure. Consider migrating all hardcoded values to use this centralized configuration system.

### 4. Directory Structure
The relative path approach for camera directories is more portable. Consider applying this pattern to other modules that might have similar permission issues.

### 5. Sensor Robustness
Consider implementing retry mechanisms and fallback values for sensor readings to improve system stability during hardware issues.
